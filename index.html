                  <p>I've seen people get excited and create dreams of how their business will turn out. They can easily see themselves sitting on top of an internet empire. And that's about as far as most get. As they begin to start trying to create content an overwhelming feeling creeps in. Procrastination starts and they just stop and get nothing done. <br/><br/>
<a>#1 Problem: Most People don't know how to start making content.</a> Some never get started. Some keep searching for an automated magical potion to give them content (content that could even kill your business).  The rest get a few pieces completed and feel frustrated that they spend too much time. These experiences can quickly create negative feelings that can end your internet dream. Before you know it, you've got Content Creators Block.</p>

                  <p>Content is just time: To get your business growing all you need to do is spend some time. Time spent making content. Real, original, relevant and valuable content. You are then on your way to building your business.<br/><br/>
Let me give you one suggestion. Set a simple goal to make a piece of content in a specified time and do it regularly. Set aside time each day and focus yourself to do content creation. You won't get anywhere without setting goals and sticking to them - NO MATTER WHAT. Anyone can do it.<br/><br/> 
Sounds easy right. You could even pump-and-push yourself to act on that suggestion. You should. Like serious athletes are dedicated and talented, some content creators generate a magic strength that pushes them beyond their limits to make a fortune. But the rest of us who are not athlete content makers, we make content slowly and feel the pain.<br/><br/>
Very few people improve their content creation speed. Most hope and expect it will take just a few minutes. Most people spend hours and hours frustrated. For just one simple piece of content. They spend hours clicking page after page. Grabbing broad snippets and writing prompts, facts, quotes, stats, videos, reference material and more. Then they get stuck. Unsure of what topics to write about. When they start writing about their topic, they find they lack the detail and information to complete a quality piece. That’s when people start feeling the pain. They start coming up with excuses to stop working on content. -  BAM. Content Creators Block hits.</p>

                  <p>Look every time you go to produce content the first thing you do is search. Maybe you look over your Facebook feed, twitter or stumble around a forum or news site. You click page after page - skimming, reading, snipping and copying points you think are cool. Stuff that you think you could make content from. Hours later after reading thousands of words, your brain is overloading with too much information. Squeezing out a sentence becomes hard. <br/><br/>
                  
Everyone starts off excited and it seems simple enough. But soon, Content Creators Block hits you. In an of ocean of pages and content you are unable to quickly get a topic and key information to complete a finished piece of content fast enough.<br/><br/>

To fix content writers block you need to launch yourself past the starting hurdle and into content creation at any time. Crunch through 100s of pages. Pull out topics, questions and details you can quote, reference and write about. You need a solution to end hours and hours of frustration working out where to start and boost your momentum with detail in a click..</p>

                  <p>No other software exists that's comparable to ContentPerfect360. Two and half years ago, we tried to find solutions to help us with content marketing. Tackle the main problems of sorting through large amounts of information from across the web. Find topics and information without losing 100s of hours and our sanity. We couldn't find anything. Sure, there are many content discovery and curation tools but they only take you to a page. You still need to READ a huge amount which can hurt your eyes and your brain!<br/><br/>
We know internet and content marketers like us need software that goes out and grabs all the content from a starting page - a serp, a forum, a news site - any web page. Then tell us what all the content is about. What’s everyone writing and talking about? We needed to be able to understand 100s and 1000s of pages real fast without having to read them all.<br/><br/>
During the last 2 years, my friend Jameer and I worked on the solution. Jameer is a software engineer and has a PhD in Image Processing. His thesis is Trimodal Biometric Personal Authentication Systems. Coupled with my 22 years' experience in high tech marketing and software design and architecture we went to work. </p>

                  <p>We worked through many areas of software engineering: algorithms, linguistics, semantics, logic and math. We built technology to do crawling, data extraction, html content analysis, natural language processing, sentence analysis. We spent a lot of time optimizing the algorithms. We knew the software needed perform these tasks blindingly fast and tell us:<br/><br/>
                  
-   What ideas dominate a set of pages?<br/>
-   What concepts and topics stand out?<br/>
-   What do the topics behind keywords look like?<br/>
-   What questions do people ask?<br/>
-   What phrases are most dominant?<br/>
-   What sentences contain valuable and key information?<br/><br/>
To do this we start with something called key phrase analysis. In a nutshell, we extract key phrases from all the pages and count the number of mentions, number of sentences and number of pages each is on. We then calculate a score for each sentence based on the score of phrases found in each sentence. Phew! This helps us see which sentences stand out based on the most powerful phrases and words across the page or pages.<br/><br/>
We count 16 other metrics to identify types of sentences; from the densities of keywords you want to focus on; latent semantic keywords of your keywords to counting noun phrases, verb noun phrases and so on. You can also tweak and optimize how each of the 16 metrics effect the sentence analysis. Topics, questions, statements, summary sentences and active expression sentences are all identified by the score method. Inspiration and detail rises to the top of the list!<br/><br/>
You can build your own relevant and valuable content by using topics and questions to prompt you. Then zero in on facts and points you can reference, quote or rewrite. You get all the sentences into a scored list you can easily filter. Find specific content ideas and detail - instantly - from 100's of pages in SECONDS!<br/><br/>
Instead of having to read 100's of pages which takes hours. Reading that can even take hours over days and eat a huge part of your brain and sanity. The software does it all for you. It does it way faster than browsing some web pages. You can be building amazing, expressive and engaging content in minutes. </p>

                  <p>I've seen people get excited and create dreams of how their business will turn out. They can easily see themselves sitting on top of an internet empire. And that's about as far as most get. As they begin to start trying to create content an overwhelming feeling creeps in. Procrastination starts and they just stop and get nothing done. <br/><br/>
<a>#1 Problem: Most People don't know how to start making content.</a> Some never get started. Some keep searching for an automated magical potion to give them content (content that could even kill your business).  The rest get a few pieces completed and feel frustrated that they spend too much time. These experiences can quickly create negative feelings that can end your internet dream. Before you know it, you've got Content Creators Block.</p>

                  <h3 align="center">Cure Content Creators Block & Writers Block (cure the #1 killer of online business dreams)</h3>
                  <p>Content is just time: To get your business growing all you need to do is spend some time. Time spent making content. Real, original, relevant and valuable content. You are then on your way to building your business.<br/><br/>
Let me give you one suggestion. Set a simple goal to make a piece of content in a specified time and do it regularly. Set aside time each day and focus yourself to do content creation. You won't get anywhere without setting goals and sticking to them - NO MATTER WHAT. Anyone can do it.<br/><br/> 
Sounds easy right. You could even pump-and-push yourself to act on that suggestion. You should. Like serious athletes are dedicated and talented, some content creators generate a magic strength that pushes them beyond their limits to make a fortune. But the rest of us who are not athlete content makers, we make content slowly and feel the pain.<br/><br/>
Very few people improve their content creation speed. Most hope and expect it will take just a few minutes. Most people spend hours and hours frustrated. For just one simple piece of content. They spend hours clicking page after page. Grabbing broad snippets and writing prompts, facts, quotes, stats, videos, reference material and more. Then they get stuck. Unsure of what topics to write about. When they start writing about their topic, they find they lack the detail and information to complete a quality piece. That’s when people start feeling the pain. They start coming up with excuses to stop working on content. -  BAM. Content Creators Block hits.</p>

                  <p>Look every time you go to produce content the first thing you do is search. Maybe you look over your Facebook feed, twitter or stumble around a forum or news site. You click page after page - skimming, reading, snipping and copying points you think are cool. Stuff that you think you could make content from. Hours later after reading thousands of words, your brain is overloading with too much information. Squeezing out a sentence becomes hard. <br/><br/>
                  
Everyone starts off excited and it seems simple enough. But soon, Content Creators Block hits you. In an of ocean of pages and content you are unable to quickly get a topic and key information to complete a finished piece of content fast enough.<br/><br/>

To fix content writers block you need to launch yourself past the starting hurdle and into content creation at any time. Crunch through 100s of pages. Pull out topics, questions and details you can quote, reference and write about. You need a solution to end hours and hours of frustration working out where to start and boost your momentum with detail in a click..</p>

                  <p>No other software exists that's comparable to ContentPerfect360. Two and half years ago, we tried to find solutions to help us with content marketing. Tackle the main problems of sorting through large amounts of information from across the web. Find topics and information without losing 100s of hours and our sanity. We couldn't find anything. Sure, there are many content discovery and curation tools but they only take you to a page. You still need to READ a huge amount which can hurt your eyes and your brain!<br/><br/>
We know internet and content marketers like us need software that goes out and grabs all the content from a starting page - a serp, a forum, a news site - any web page. Then tell us what all the content is about. What’s everyone writing and talking about? We needed to be able to understand 100s and 1000s of pages real fast without having to read them all.<br/><br/>
During the last 2 years, my friend Jameer and I worked on the solution. Jameer is a software engineer and has a PhD in Image Processing. His thesis is Trimodal Biometric Personal Authentication Systems. Coupled with my 22 years' experience in high tech marketing and software design and architecture we went to work. </p>

                  <h3 align="center">No Other Software Exists to Give You Such Detail - Diving Deep into Pages - So You Can Uncover Genius Marketing & Content Ideas Fast </h3>
                  <p>We worked through many areas of software engineering: algorithms, linguistics, semantics, logic and math. We built technology to do crawling, data extraction, html content analysis, natural language processing, sentence analysis. We spent a lot of time optimizing the algorithms. We knew the software needed perform these tasks blindingly fast and tell us:<br/><br/>
                  
-   What ideas dominate a set of pages?<br/>
-   What concepts and topics stand out?<br/>
-   What do the topics behind keywords look like?<br/>
-   What questions do people ask?<br/>
-   What phrases are most dominant?<br/>
-   What sentences contain valuable and key information?<br/><br/>
To do this we start with something called key phrase analysis. In a nutshell, we extract key phrases from all the pages and count the number of mentions, number of sentences and number of pages each is on. We then calculate a score for each sentence based on the score of phrases found in each sentence. Phew! This helps us see which sentences stand out based on the most powerful phrases and words across the page or pages.<br/><br/>
We count 16 other metrics to identify types of sentences; from the densities of keywords you want to focus on; latent semantic keywords of your keywords to counting noun phrases, verb noun phrases and so on. You can also tweak and optimize how each of the 16 metrics effect the sentence analysis. Topics, questions, statements, summary sentences and active expression sentences are all identified by the score method. Inspiration and detail rises to the top of the list!<br/><br/>
You can build your own relevant and valuable content by using topics and questions to prompt you. Then zero in on facts and points you can reference, quote or rewrite. You get all the sentences into a scored list you can easily filter. Find specific content ideas and detail - instantly - from 100's of pages in SECONDS!<br/><br/>
Instead of having to read 100's of pages which takes hours. Reading that can even take hours over days and eat a huge part of your brain and sanity. The software does it all for you. It does it way faster than browsing some web pages. You can be building amazing, expressive and engaging content in minutes. </p>
